The Julian date in the granule ID of each specific file represents the 9th day of the 16 day composite period, and consequently the observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo for that day.  The MCD43C1 algorithm, as with all combined products, has the luxury of choosing the best representative pixel from a pool that includes all the acquisitions from both the Terra and Aqua sensors from the composite period.  This product is based on a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) for the purpose of being used in climate simulation models.\n\nThe MCD43C2 provides the three snow free model weighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) used for each of the MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible (vis), near infrared (nir), and shortwave bands to derive the Albedo and BRDF products (MCD43A3 and MCD43A4).  Along with the 30 parameter layers there are 4 ancillary layers.  The MODIS BRDF/ALBEDO products have achieved stage 3 validation.\n","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aquaTerra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C2.006"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
