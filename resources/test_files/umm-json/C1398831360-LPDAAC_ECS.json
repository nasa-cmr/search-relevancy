The GFCC Surface Reflectance Estimates Multi-Year Global dataset is derived from the enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets for epochs centered on the years 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. The GLS datasets are composed of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30-meter resolution. Data available for this product represent the best available “leaf-on” date during the peak growing season. The original GLS datasets were enhanced with supplemental Landsat images when data were incomplete for the epoch or inadequate for analysis due to acquisition during “leaf-off” seasons. The enhanced GLS data were acquired June 1984 through August 2011. Atmospheric corrections were applied to seven visible bands to estimate surface reflectance by compensating for the scattering and absorption of radiance by atmospheric conditions. GFCC30SR is a multi-file data product. The surface reflectance data products are used as source data for other datasets in the GFCC collection.\r\n\r\nFor each available date, data files are delivered in a .zip folder that consists of six surface reflectance bands, a Top of Atmosphere temperature band, an Atmospheric Opacity layer, and the Landsat Surface Reflectance Quality layer. Data follow the Worldwide Reference System-2 tiling scheme. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/gfcc_atbd.pdf).","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30SR.001"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:43:52.415Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:51:39.583Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"GEODETIC"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Value":"10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30SR.001","Name":"identifier_product_doi","Description":"Digital object identifier that uniquely identifies this data product","DataType":"STRING"},{"Value":"http://dx.doi.org","Name":"identifier_product_doi_authority","Description":"URL of the digital object identifier resolving authority","DataType":"STRING"}],"ScienceKeywords":[{"Category":"EARTH SCIENCE","Topic":"LAND SURFACE","Term":"SURFACE RADIATIVE PROPERTIES","VariableLevel1":"REFLECTANCE"}],"EntryTitle":"Global Forest Cover Change Surface Reflectance Estimates Multi-Year Global 30m V001","CollectionProgress":"COMPLETE","ProcessingLevel":{"ProcessingLevelDescription":"Sensor Measurements","Id":"2"},"Platforms":[{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-7","LongName":"LANDSAT-7","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-5","LongName":"LANDSAT-5","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"TERRA","LongName":"Earth Observing System, TERRA (AM-1)","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectroradiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Cross-track Scanning Radiometer","Technique":"Radiometry"}]},{"ShortName":"ASTER","LongName":"Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TIR","LongName":"Thermal Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"VNIR","LongName":"Visible Near Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"SWIR","LongName":"Shortwave Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"}]}]}],"Version":"001","TemporalExtents":[{"TemporalRangeType":"Continuous Range","PrecisionOfSeconds":0,"EndsAtPresentFlag":false,"RangeDateTimes":[{"BeginningDateTime":"1984-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","EndingDateTime":"2011-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"}]}],"DataCenters":[{"Roles":["PROCESSOR"],"ShortName":"UMD/GLCF","LongName":"Global Land Cover Facility, University of Maryland","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"http://glcf.umd.edu/"}],"Addresses":[{"StateProvince":"Maryland","Country":"United States"}]}},{"Roles":["ARCHIVER"],"ShortName":"LP DAAC","LongName":"Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/"}],"ServiceHours":"M-F, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time","ContactInstruction":"None","ContactMechanisms":[{"Type":"Telephone","Value":"605-594-6116"},{"Type":"Fax","Value":"605-594-6963"},{"Type":"Email","Value":"lpdaac@usgs.gov"}],"Addresses":[{"StreetAddresses":["U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center"],"City":"Sioux Falls","StateProvince":"South Dakota","Country":"United States","PostalCode":"57198"}]}}]}
