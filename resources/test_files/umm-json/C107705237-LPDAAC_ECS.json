Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\r\n\r\nGlobal MOD13Q1 data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Lacking a 250m blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts.\r\n\r\nVegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, including primary production and land cover conversion.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS Vegetation Indices products have attained Validation Stage 3.\r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nPhased production between Terra and Aqua products for improved temporal frequency (Terra 16-day period starting Day 001, Aqua 16-day period starting Day 009)\r\nReplaced NDVI_QA and EVI_QA with one VI_QA Science Data Set\r\nReduced file volume by using internal compression\r\nMore: MODIS Vegetation Index Product Series Collection 5 Change Summary (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/QA_WWW/forPage/MOD13_VI_C5_Changes_Document_06_28_06.pdf)\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 18, 2000 - March 21, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nFile Size: ~5-270 MB \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nDimensions: 4800 x 4800 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 250 meters \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/310"},{"Description":"\n         Interface for discovering, accessing, and invoking EOS data products and services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to download to all currently available MODIS products by FTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
