MOD11C3, therefore, inherits all the structural features of its MOD11C1 parent except for the temporal configuration. Please refer to the MOD11C1 product documentation for all algorithm-related details.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11C3 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and emissivities for bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11C3, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11C3 products have a temporal acquisition range, which starts March 1, 2000 (2000-065), and continued through March 31, 2017. The V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: V005 March 1, 2000 – March 31, 2017\r\nArea: Global \r\nSize: 3600 x 7200 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 0.05 degrees (5600 meters at the Equator) \r\nFile Size: ~80 MB compressed\r\nProjection: Geographic (Lat/Lon grid)\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 17","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/284"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
