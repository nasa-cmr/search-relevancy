Each product delivery includes one DEM data file, and fifteen orthorectified data files in GeoTIFF format.\r\n\r\nASTER SWIR data acquired from April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\nASTER DEM\r\n\r\nThe ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product is generated using Bands 3N (nadir-viewing) and 3B (backward-viewing) of an ASTER Level-1A image acquired by the Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) sensor. The VNIR subsystem includes two independent telescopes. Together, they produce stereoscopic data. The spectral range of the Band 3 stereo pair is between 0.78 and 0.86 µm with a base-to-height ratio of 0.6, and an intersection angle of about 27.7. There is a time lag of approximately one minute between the acquisition of the nadir and backward-viewing images.\r\n\r\nASTER DEM is a single-band product with 30 meter horizontal postings that is geodetically referenced to the UTM coordinate system, and referenced to the Earth's geoid using the EGM96 geopotential model. The precision of the meets or exceeds accuracy specifications set for the ASTER relative DEMs by the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). Validation testing has shown that the accuracy of the DEMs is frequently better than 25 meters RMSE xyz.\r\n\r\nASTER Orthorectified Images\r\n\r\nThe ASTER Orthorectified Image products contain imagery transformed from a perspective projection to an orthogonal one. An orthorectified image possesses the geometric characteristics of a map, with near-vertical views for every location. These products are terrain-corrected, provide radiometrically calibrated radiance, and are mapped to the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system. The inputs include the following: an ASTER Level-1A Reconstructed Unprocessed Instrument data set; georeferencing information from the ASTER instrument's and Terra platform's ephemeris and attitude data; and an ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM). The output product includes fifteen orthorectified ASTER Level-1B calibrated radiance images, one per Band.\r\n\r\nDifferences between an ASTER Level-1B data set and ASTER Orthorectified Images\r\n\r\n     - ASTER Level-1B data consist of calibrated radiance in a path-oriented\r\n        UTM projection, whereas ASTER orthorectified images are presented in\r\n        a north-up UTM projection. \r\n\r\n     - ASTER orthorectified images possess the geometric characteristics of a\r\n        map with near-vertical views for every location, and they also are\r\n        terrain-corrected.\r\n\r\n     - ASTER L1B image dimensions for each of the three sensor systems (VNIR,\r\n        SWIR, and TIR) are different because of their different spatial\r\n        resolutions; those image dimensions remain constant from one L1B scene\r\n        to another. However, ASTER orthorectified image dimensions can vary\r\n        from scene to scene. This is because the image dimensions of the ASTER\r\n        Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used in the orthorectification process\r\n        can vary, and the DEMs image dimensions define the output dimensions\r\n        for each of the three sensors orthorectified images.\r\n\r\n     - The ASTER Level-1B data set is provided in a single multi-file packaged\r\n        Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) with specific Earth Observing System\r\n        (EOS) conventions. The ASTER orthorectified image file format is\r\n        GeoTIFF. The file includes fifteen orthorectified ASTER Level-1B \r\n        calibrated radiance images, one for each Band. These image files are \r\n        compressed and provided to the user in a single zip file. \r\n\r\nV003 data set release date: 2007-03-05\r\n\r\nData Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~60 km x 60 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 2500 rows x 2500 columns \r\nFile Size: ~191 MB \r\nUnits: w/m2/sr/µm\r\nProjection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \r\nData Format: GeoTIFF\r\nData Fields: 1","PublicationReferences":[{"OnlineResource":{"Linkage":"Not%20provided","Name":"Reference Online Resource","Description":"Reference Online Resource"}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"The USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) is an online search and order tool driven by browse images.
