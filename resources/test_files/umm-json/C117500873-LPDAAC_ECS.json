MOD17A2 is an 8-day composite at 1-km spatial resolution delivered as a gridded level-4 product in Sinusoidal projection.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) at the Goddard Spaceflight Center produces this GPP product.  Users are encouraged to use the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG)/University of Montana’s (UMT) version of this product available as version-55 from the LP DAAC.  For more information, refer to the product details via the “Version 055” tab.  \r\n\r\nVersion-5 and Version-55 Terra/MODIS GPP products are validated to Stage-3; this means that its accuracy was assessed and uncertainties in the product were well-established via independent measurements made in a systematic and statistically robust way that represents global conditions.  These data are deemed ready for use in science applications.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~0.2 MB \r\nResolution: 1 kilometer \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 3","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/95"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=MOD17A25"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web (MRTWeb) is available for selected MODIS land products.
