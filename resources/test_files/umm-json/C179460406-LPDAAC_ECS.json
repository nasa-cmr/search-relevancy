This is usually done to support on-going field calibration and validation efforts or to support emergency response to natural disasters when processed Level-1 data with minimum turn-around time would prove beneficial in initial damage or impact assessments. The granule content of this expedited data set is subject to change, because individual granules are held for a maximum of 30 days past ingest, then deleted. This is done because the routinely processed (Production Data Set or PDS) version of this data set will be available from Japan in due course and available for search and order from the LP DAAC archives. ASTER Expedited Data Sets (EDS) serve the short-term requirements of a small group of scientists and fulfill immediate imagery needs during times of natural disasters. \r\n\r\nUsers are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\nThe general product description details as described for the ASTER Level-1B Data Set – Registered Radiance at the Sensor apply to the expedited data set with a few notable exceptions.  These include:\r\n     - The Expedited Level-1B data set does not contain the VNIR 3B (aft-viewing) band\r\n     - This data set does not have short-term calibration for the Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensor\r\n     - The registration quality of this data set is likely to be lower, and also vary from scene to scene\r\n\r\nV003 data set release date: 2002-05-03\r\n\r\nData Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~60 km x 60 km \r\nImage Dimensions: \r\n  VNIR: 4200 rows x 4980 columns \r\n  SWIR: 2100 rows x 2490 columns \r\n  TIR: 700 rows x 830 columns \r\nFile Size: \r\n  VNIR (1, 2, 3N): ~63 MB \r\n  SWIR (4 through 9): ~32 MB \r\n  TIR (10 through 14): ~6 MB \r\n  Total: 97 Megabytes \r\nSpatial Resolution:\r\n  VNIR: 15m\r\n  SWIR: 30m\r\n  TIR: 90m\r\nUnits: w/m2/sr/µm\r\nProjection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS or GeoTIFF\r\nVgroup Data Fields = 14","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1BE.003"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=AST_L1BE3"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is one of several discipline-specific data centers within the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).
