The primary land cover scheme identifies 17 land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which includes 11 natural vegetation classes, 3 developed and mosaicked land classes, and three non-vegetated land classes.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Terra + Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500 m SIN Grid product incorporates five different land cover classification schemes, derived through a supervised decision-tree classification method:\r\n\r\nLand Cover Type 1: IGBP global vegetation classification scheme\r\nLand Cover Type 2: University of Maryland (UMD) scheme\r\nLand Cover Type 3: MODIS-derived LAI/fPAR scheme\r\nLand Cover Type 4: MODIS-derived Net Primary Production (NPP) scheme\r\nLand Cover Type 5: Plant Functional Type (PFT) scheme\r\n\r\nV051 Land Cover Type products are produced with revised training data and certain algorithm refinements.
