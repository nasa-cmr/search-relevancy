The MCD64A1 mapping approach employs 500 meter MODIS Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer MODIS active fire observations. The algorithm uses a burn sensitive vegetation index (VI) to create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite imagery. The VI is derived from MODIS short-wave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture. The algorithm ultimately identifies the date of burn for the 500 meter grid cells within each individual MODIS tile. The date is encoded in a single data layer as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred (range 1-366), with a value of 0 for unburned land pixels and additional special values reserved for missing-data and water grid cells. The MCD64A1 data product has achieved the level 3 validation.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n    1.\t The product is now generated using an improved version of the Giglio et al. (2009) MCD64 burned area mapping algorithm (i.e., MCD64A1 will be      adopted as the standard MODIS burned area product\r\nfor Collection 6). The MCD45A1 product will not be generated beyond Collection 5.1.\r\n    2.\t The product is generated using Version 6 (versus Version 5) surface reflectance and active fire input data.\r\n    3.\t General improvement (reduced omission error) in burned area detection including significantly better detection of small burns.\r\n    4.\t Modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty.\r\n    5.\t Significant reduction in the occurrence of unclassified grid cells due to algorithm changes and refinements in the upstream Version 6 input data.\r\n    6.\t Product coverage expanded from 219 to 268 MODIS tiles.\r\n    7.\t Expanded per-pixel quality assurance (QA) product layer.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile
