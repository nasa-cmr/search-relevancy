This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in Bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nMYD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the level-2 LST product (MYD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The MYD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and Bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.\r\n\r\nAqua/MODIS V5  LST/E products, including MYD11A1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MYD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\nThe V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.
