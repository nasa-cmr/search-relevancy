The CMG product (Short name: MCD12C1) is derived using the same algorithm that produces the V051 Global 500 m Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1). It contains three classification schemes, which describe the land cover properties derived from observations spanning a year’s input of Terra and Aqua MODIS data. The primary land cover scheme identifies 17 land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which includes 11 natural vegetation classes, 3 developed and mosaicked land classes, and 3 non-vegetated land classes. It includes the following three classification schemes, derived through a supervised decision-tree classification method: \r\n\r\nLand Cover Type 1: IGBP global vegetation classification scheme \r\nLand Cover Type 2: University of Maryland (UMD) scheme\r\nLand Cover Type 3: MODIS-derived LAI/FPAR scheme      \r\n\r\nAdditional layers include a Land Cover Type Assessment SDS, a Land Cover Percent SDS, and a Land Cover Quality Control SDS. \r\n\r\nV051 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: Global \r\nImage Dimensions: \r\nLC Type: 3600 x 7200 (rows/columns) \r\nLC Percent: rows/columns/number of LC classes \r\nFile Size: ~1200 MB \r\nResolution: 0.05° (~5600 m) \r\nProjection: Geographic \r\nData Type:  8-bit unsigned integer\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (HDF SDS Layers): 10","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/273"},{"Description":"   LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
