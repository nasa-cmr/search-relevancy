This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\nThe precision terrain correction incorporates ground control points with a digital elevation model to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold, with alternate levels of correction possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g. cloud cover).\r\n\r\nEach precision terrain corrected image has an independent quality assessment of the geometric correction available for distribution. both as a text file and a single band browse image with the valid GCPs overlaid.\r\n \r\nThis multi-file product also includes a visible/shortwave (VNIR/SWIR) infrared pseudo true color composite and/or a thermal infrared (TIR) pseudo true color composite full resolution image depending on the bands acquired in the Level-1A. No special data analysis software is required to use these GeoTIFF images. \r\n\r\nDifferences between the ASTER Level-1T and the corresponding Level-1B and Orthorectified data products:\r\n•\tASTER Level-1B at-sensor radiance is in a path-oriented projection as opposed to the north-up UTM projection available in both the ASTER Level-1T and ASTER Orthorectified products.\r\n•\tASTER Level-1B images dimensions for each of the three sensor subsystems (VNIR, SWIR, and TIR) remain constant from one scene to the next, but the ASTER Level-1T and ASTER Orthorectifed image dimensions vary by scene because of the rotation process.\r\n•\tASTER Orthorectified at-sensor radiance is produced using proprietary software and corrected using an ASTER derived digital elevation model and ground control points, whereas the ASTER Level-1T uses the GLS2000 digital elevation data, which is a bare ground DEM, and derived ground control points with Land Processes (LP) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) modified Landsat geometric algorithms.  \r\n•\tThe ASTER Level-1T is a multi-file product generated with a single resampling from the ASTER Level-1A input scene to provide low-resolution browse, full resolution imagery, and an independent geometric verification report with browse in addition to standard metadata.","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"The LP DAAC Data Set Landing Page provides specific information for each of the ASTER Land Products distributed from LP DAAC.","URLContentType":"CollectionURL","Type":"DATA SET LANDING PAGE","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1T.003"},{"Description":"LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available products and the ability to download them via FTP.
