An orthorectified image possesses the geometric characteristics of a map, with near-vertical views for every location. \r\n\r\nASTER SWIR data acquired from April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\nThese products are terrain-corrected, provide radiometrically calibrated radiance, and are mapped to the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system.\r\n\r\nThe inputs include the following: an ASTER Level-1A Reconstructed Unprocessed Instrument data set; georeferencing information from the ASTER instrument's and Terra platform's ephemeris and attitude data; and an ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM). The output product includes fifteen orthorectified ASTER Level-1B calibrated radiance images, one per Band, as listed below.\r\n\r\nDifferences between an ASTER Level-1B data set and ASTER Orthorectified Images\r\n\r\n     -  ASTER Level-1B data consist of calibrated radiance in a path-oriented\r\n        UTM projection, whereas ASTER orthorectified images are presented in a\r\n        north-up UTM projection. ASTER orthorectified images possess the\r\n        geometric characteristics of a map with near-vertical views for every\r\n        location, and they also are terrain-corrected.\r\n\r\n    -  ASTER L1B image dimensions for each of the three sensor systems (VNIR,\r\n        SWIR, and TIR) are different because of their different spatial \r\n        resolutions; those image dimensions remain constant from one L1B scene \r\n        to another. However, ASTER orthorectified image dimensions can vary \r\n        from scene to scene. This is because the image dimensions of the ASTER \r\n        Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used in the orthorectification process \r\n        can vary, and the DEMs image dimensions define the output dimensions \r\n        for each of the three sensors orthorectified images.  \r\n\r\n    -  The ASTER Level-1B data set is provided in a single multi-file packaged \r\n        Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) with specific EOS conventions. The ASTER\r\n        orthorectified image file format is GeoTIFF. The file includes fifteen \r\n        orthorectified ASTER Level-1B calibrated radiance images, one for each \r\n        Band. These image files are compressed and provided to the user in a \r\n        single zip file.\r\n\r\nV003 data set release date: 2007-03-05\r\n\r\nData Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~60 km x 60 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 2500 rows x 2500 columns \r\nFile Size: ~132 MB \r\nUnits: w/m2/sr/Âµm\r\nProjection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \r\nData Format: GeoTIFF\r\nData Fields: 1","PublicationReferences":[{"OnlineResource":{"Linkage":"Not%20provided","Name":"Reference Online Resource","Description":"Reference Online Resource"}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"https://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"The USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) is an online search and order tool driven by browse images.
