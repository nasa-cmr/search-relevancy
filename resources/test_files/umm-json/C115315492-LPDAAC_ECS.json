Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products. \n\nThe MOD09Q1 product provides Band 1 and 2 data at a 250-meter resolution in an 8-day gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Each MOD09Q1 pixel contains the best possible L2G observation during an 8-day period as selected on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance values for Bands 1 and 2, and a quality  rating. \n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \nImage Dimensions: 4800 x 4800 rows/columns \nFile Size: ~72 MB compressed \nResolution: 250 meters \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 3","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/294"},{"Description":"\n         Interface for discovering, accessing, and invoking EOS data products and services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=MYD09Q15"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to download to all currently available MODIS products by HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web is available for selected MODIS land product tiles.
