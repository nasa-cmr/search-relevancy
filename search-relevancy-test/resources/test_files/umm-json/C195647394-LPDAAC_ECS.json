LAI ignores canopy details such as leaf angle distribution, canopy height or shape. LAI values typically range from 0 for bare ground to 6 or above for a dense forest. Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) is also a dimensionless variable defined as the fraction of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation. FPAR is directly related to the primary productivity function of photosynthesis, and therefore, used to estimate the assimilation of CO2 in vegetation. Both variables are used to calculate surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which help model the terrestrial energy, carbon, and biogeochemical components of vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the Terra-MODIS (MOD15A2), Aqua-MODIS (MYD15A2), and the combined Terra and Aqua MODIS (MCD15A2) versions of the 8-day LAI and FPAR products, the level-4 combined (Terra and Aqua) MODIS global LAI and FPAR product is composited every 4 days at 1-kilometer resolution. Projected on a Sinusoidal grid, the MCD15A3 product includes the following Science Data Sets (SDS): LAI, FPAR, and a set of quality rating, and standard deviation layers for each variable. The increased temporal frequency of the 4-day product helps in monitoring phenology and associated rapid changes (that occur within less than a week) especially during transition periods (green-up and senescence).\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics:  \r\nTemporal Coverage: July 4, 2002 - March 29, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nSpatial Resolution: 1 km\r\nFile Size: 1.1 MB\r\nResolution: 1000 meters\r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 6","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/287"},{"Description":"         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.
