The Julian date in the granule ID of each specific file represents the 9th day of the 16 day composite period, and consequently the observations are weighted to estimate the Albedo for that day.  The MCD43A4 algorithm, as is with all combined products, has the luxury of choosing the best representative pixel from a pool that includes all the acquisitions from both the Terra and Aqua sensors from the composite period.\n\nThe MCD43A4 provides the 500 meter reflectance data of the MODIS “land” bands 1-7 adjusted using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to model the values as if they were collected from a nadir view. The MODIS BRDF/Albedo products have achieved stage 3 validation.\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aquaTerra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A4.006"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
