This algorithm is optimally used to separate ranges of atmospheric column water vapor and lower boundary air surface temperatures into tractable sub-ranges. The surface emissivities in bands 31 and 32 are estimated from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11A1 products are projected in a Sinusoidal grid by mapping the level-2 LST product (MOD11_L2) on 1-kilometer (precisely 0.928-km) grids. The MOD11A1 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.\r\n\r\nThe V5 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11A1, are validated to Stage-2 through field campaigns and radiance-based validation studies. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products are available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications.\r\n\r\nThe V5 MOD11A1 product’s acquisition range started March 5, 2000 (2000-065) and will continue until sometime after the V6 reprocessing is complete. The V5 collection is not consistent with V4 and V41, and users should exercise caution as they plan to use the different collections.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: V005 March 5, 2000 – March 30, 2017\r\nArea: ~1100 x 1100 km \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nSpatial Resolution: ~1 kilometer (actual: 0.93km) \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nFile Size: ~2.1 MB \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 12","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/20"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
