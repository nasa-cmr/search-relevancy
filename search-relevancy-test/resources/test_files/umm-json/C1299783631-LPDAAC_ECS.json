Each product delivery includes two Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) files: one for the VNIR, and the other for the SWIR. Both the VNIR and the SWIR data are atmospherically corrected using the corresponding bands from an ASTER Level 1B image.\r\n\r\nASTER SWIR data acquired from April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods.
