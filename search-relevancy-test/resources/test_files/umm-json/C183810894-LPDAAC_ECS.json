Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 470-nanometers, 648-nanometers, and 848-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.\n\nThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for historical applications. The MODIS NDVI product contains atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances masked for water, clouds, and cloud shadows. Another MODIS index, the Enhanced Vegetation Index or EVI, uses the blue band to remove residual atmospheric contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cirrus clouds. The EVI also uses feedback adjustment to minimize canopy background variations and to enhance vegetation sensitivity from sparse to dense vegetation conditions.\n\nGlobal MYD13C1 data are cloud-free spatial composites of the gridded 16-day 1-kilometer MYD13A2, and are provided as a level-3 product projected on a 0.05 degree (5600-meter) geographic Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). Cloud-free global coverage is achieved by replacing clouds with the historical MODIS time series climatology record.\n\nVegetation indices are used for globally monitoring vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties, including land cover.\n\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: Global \nImage Dimensions: 3600 x 7200 rows/columns \nFile Size: ~100 MB \nResolution: ~5600 meters (0.05 degrees) \nProjection: Lat/Long Grid \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 13","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/77"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"tp://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=MYD13C15"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is one of several discipline-specific data centers within the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).
