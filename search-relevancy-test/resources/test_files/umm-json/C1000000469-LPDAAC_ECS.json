The Julian date in the granule ID of each specific file represents the 9th day of the 16 day composite period, and consequently the observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo for that day.  The MCD43A1 algorithm, as is with all combined products, has the luxury of choosing the best representative pixel from a pool that includes all the acquisitions from both the Terra and Aqua sensors from the composite period.\nThe MCD43A1 provides the three model weighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) for each of the MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible (vis), near infrared (nir), and shortwave bands used to derive the Albedo and BRDF products (MCD43A3 and MCD43A4).  Along with the 3 dimensional parameter layers for these bands are the Mandatory Quality layers for each of the 10 bands.  The MODIS BRDF/ALBEDO products have achieved stage 3 validation.","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aquaTerra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A1.006"},{"Description":"         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.
