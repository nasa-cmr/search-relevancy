Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\r\n\r\nMOD09CMG provides Bands 1–7 in a daily level-3 product gridded on a simple 0.05 degree (5,600-meter) Geographic projection. Data for each pixel is selected on the basis of low solar zenith angle, minimum Band 3 (blue) reflectance, and absence of cloud from level-3 intermediate files. Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance values for Bands 1–7, brightness temperatures for Bands 20, 21, 31, and 32, solar and view zenith angles, relative azimuth angle, ozone, granule time, and quality assessment.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance products are Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts. \r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nReduced number of data products: MOD09GST, MOD09GHK, MODMGGAD, MODPT1KD, and MODPTHKM encapsulated within MOD09GA\r\nReduced file volume: internal compression\r\nImproved aerosol retrieval\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics:\r\nTemporal Coverage: February 24, 2000 - March 30, 2017\r\nArea: Global \r\nFile Size: ~985 MB \r\nProjection: Latitude/Longitude \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nImage Dimensions: 3600 x 7200 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 0.05 degrees (5600 meters) \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 21","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/303"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via FTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
