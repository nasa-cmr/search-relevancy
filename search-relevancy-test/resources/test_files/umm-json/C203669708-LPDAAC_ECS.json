Annual NPP is derived from the sum of the 45, 8-day Net Photosynthesis  (PSN) products (MYD17A2H) from the given year.  The PSN value is the difference of the GPP and the Maintenance Respiration (MR) (GPP-MR). Stage 3 validation has been achieved for MOD17 products.","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD17A3H.006"},{"Description":"         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.
