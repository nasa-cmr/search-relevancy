ASTER data are primarily acquired and processed in support of a global mapping mission, and based on Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from authorized users. ASTER Level-1 data are produced at the Ground Data System (GDS) facility of Japan Space Systems in Tokyo, Japan, and subsequently sent to the Land Processes (LP) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for archiving, distribution, and higher-level product generation. The ASTER Level-1A data set contains reconstructed, instrument digital numbers (DNs) derived from the telemetry streams of the 3 telescopes: Visible Near Infrared (VNIR), Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR). The Level-1A data contains depacketized, demultiplexed, and realigned instrument image data with their geometric correction coefficients and radiometric calibration coefficients calculated and appended but not applied. It also includes corrections for the SWIR parallax, and intra- and inter-telescope registration information. \r\n\r\nUsers are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\nV003 data set release date: 2002-05-03\r\n\r\nData Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~60km x 60km \r\nImage Dimensions: \r\n  VNIR: 4200 rows x 4100 columns \r\n  VNIR (3B): 5400 rows x 5000 columns \r\n  SWIR: 2100 rows x 2048 columns \r\n  TIR: 700 rows x 700 columns \r\nFile Size: \r\n  VNIR (1,2,3N): ~50 MB \r\n  VNIR (3B): 30 MB \r\n  SWIR (4-9): ~25 MB \r\n  TIR (10-14): ~5 MB\r\n  Total: 110 Megabytes\r\nSpatial Resolution:\r\n  VNIR: 15m\r\n  SWIR: 30m\r\n  TIR: 90m \r\nUnits: Digital counts\r\nProjection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS, GeoTIFF\r\nData Fields: 15","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"The LP DAAC Data Set Landing Page provides specific information for each of the ASTER Land Products distributed from LP DAAC.","URLContentType":"CollectionURL","Type":"DATA SET LANDING PAGE","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003"},{"Description":"Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is one of several discipline-specific data centers within the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).
