Along with MODIS bands 1-7 are 18 additional 5600 m resolution layers including thermal bands 20, 21, 31, and 32 in Brightness Temperature and the QA and observation bands. This product is based on a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) for use in climate simulation models. Validation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS Surface Reflectance products.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n•\tImprovement to the aerosol retrieval and correction algorithm and use of new aerosol retrieval Look up Tables.\r\n•\tRefinements to the internal snow, cloud, and cloud shadow detection algorithms. Uses BRDF database to better constraint the different threshold used.\r\n•\tProcesses ocean bands to create a new Surface Reflectance Ocean product and provide QA data sets for these bands.\r\n•\tImproved discrimination of salt pans from cloud and snow and flag salt pan in QA band.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD09CMG.006"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2010-08-31T14:10:58.166Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2015-09-30T10:47:31.435Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"ZoneIdentifier":"Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)","Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"CARTESIAN"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Name":"PROCESSVERSION","Description":"Version of the process software that generated the product.","DataType":"STRING"},{"Value":"10.5067/MODIS/MOD09CMG.006","Name":"identifier_product_doi","Description":"Digital object identifier that uniquely identifies this data product","DataType":"STRING"},{"Value":"http://dx.doi.org","Name":"identifier_product_doi_authority","Description":"URL of the digital object identifier resolving authority","DataType":"STRING"}],"ScienceKeywords":[{"Category":"EARTH SCIENCE","Topic":"LAND SURFACE","Term":"SURFACE RADIATIVE PROPERTIES","VariableLevel1":"REFLECTANCE"}],"EntryTitle":"MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance Daily L3 Global 0.05Deg CMG V006","CollectionProgress":"ACTIVE","ProcessingLevel":{"ProcessingLevelDescription":"Sensor Measurements","Id":"3"},"Platforms":[{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"Terra","LongName":"Earth Observing System, TERRA (AM-1)","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectroradiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Cross-track Scanning Radiometer","Technique":"Radiometry"}]}]}],"Version":"006","TemporalExtents":[{"TemporalRangeType":"RangeDateTime","PrecisionOfSeconds":1,"EndsAtPresentFlag":true,"RangeDateTimes":[{"BeginningDateTime":"2000-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"}]}],"DataCenters":[{"Roles":["ARCHIVER"],"ShortName":"LP DAAC","LongName":"Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/"}],"ServiceHours":"M-F, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time","ContactInstruction":"None","ContactMechanisms":[{"Type":"Telephone","Value":"605-594-6116"},{"Type":"Fax","Value":"605-594-6963"},{"Type":"Email","Value":"lpdaac@usgs.gov"}],"Addresses":[{"StreetAddresses":["U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center"],"City":"Sioux Falls","StateProvince":"South Dakota","Country":"United States","PostalCode":"57198"}]}},{"Roles":["PROCESSOR"],"ShortName":"NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/HBSL/BISB/MODAPS","LongName":"MODIS Adaptive Processing System, Biospheric Information Systems Branch, Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences Laboratory, Earth Sciences Division, Science and Exploration Directorate, Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov"}],"ContactInstruction":"Contact for data content concerns","ContactMechanisms":[{"Type":"Telephone","Value":"301-614-5515"},{"Type":"Email","Value":"Edward.J.Masuoka@nasa.gov"}],"Addresses":[{"StreetAddresses":["NASA/GSFC Code 922"],"City":"GREENBELT","StateProvince":"Maryland","Country":"United States","PostalCode":"20771"}]}}]}
