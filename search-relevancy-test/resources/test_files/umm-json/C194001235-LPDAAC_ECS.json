A CMG granule is a Geographic grid with 7200 columns and 3600 rows representing the entire globe. The LST and emissivity values in the MOD11C3 product are derived by compositing and averaging the values from the corresponding months MOD11C1 daily files.  The MOD11C3 granule consists of 17 layers. These layers include day and night LST and their corresponding quality indicator (QC) layers, six Emissivity layers, and seven observation layers. Validation at stage 2 has been achieved for all MODIS LST/Emissivity products.","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD11C3.006"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
