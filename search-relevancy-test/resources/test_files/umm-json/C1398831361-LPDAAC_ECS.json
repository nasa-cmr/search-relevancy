The GFCC Forest Cover Change Multi-Year Global dataset provides estimates of changes in forest cover from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2005 at 30-meter spatial resolution. The GFCC30FCC product represents a global record of fine-scale changes in forest dynamics between observation periods. The forest cover change product was generated from the GFCC Tree Cover product (GFCC30TC) which is based on Global Land Survey (GLS) data acquired by the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors. \r\n\r\nEach forest cover product has two GeoTIFF files associated with it; a change map file and a change probability file. Data follow the Worldwide Reference System-2 tiling scheme. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/gfcc_atbd.pdf).\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30FCC.001"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:43:51.658Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:51:04.389Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"GEODETIC"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Value":"10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30FCC.001","Name":"identifier_product_doi","Description":"Digital object identifier that uniquely identifies this data product","DataType":"STRING"},{"Value":"http://dx.doi.org","Name":"identifier_product_doi_authority","Description":"URL of the digital object identifier resolving authority","DataType":"STRING"}],"ScienceKeywords":[{"Category":"EARTH SCIENCE","Topic":"AGRICULTURE","Term":"FOREST SCIENCE","VariableLevel1":"FOREST HARVESTING AND ENGINEERING"}],"EntryTitle":"Global Forest Cover Change Forest Cover Change Multi-Year Global 30m V001","CollectionProgress":"COMPLETE","ProcessingLevel":{"ProcessingLevelDescription":"Sensor Measurements","Id":"3"},"Platforms":[{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-7","LongName":"LANDSAT-7","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-5","LongName":"LANDSAT-5","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"TERRA","LongName":"Earth Observing System, TERRA (AM-1)","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectroradiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Cross-track Scanning Radiometer","Technique":"Radiometry"}]},{"ShortName":"ASTER","LongName":"Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TIR","LongName":"Thermal Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"VNIR","LongName":"Visible Near Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"SWIR","LongName":"Shortwave Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"}]}]}],"Version":"001","TemporalExtents":[{"TemporalRangeType":"Continuous Range","PrecisionOfSeconds":0,"EndsAtPresentFlag":false,"RangeDateTimes":[{"BeginningDateTime":"1984-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","EndingDateTime":"2011-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"}]}],"DataCenters":[{"Roles":["PROCESSOR"],"ShortName":"UMD/GLCF","LongName":"Global Land Cover Facility, University of Maryland","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"http://glcf.umd.edu/"}],"Addresses":[{"StateProvince":"Maryland","Country":"United States"}]}},{"Roles":["ARCHIVER"],"ShortName":"LP DAAC","LongName":"Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/"}],"ServiceHours":"M-F, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time","ContactInstruction":"None","ContactMechanisms":[{"Type":"Telephone","Value":"605-594-6116"},{"Type":"Fax","Value":"605-594-6963"},{"Type":"Email","Value":"lpdaac@usgs.gov"}],"Addresses":[{"StreetAddresses":["U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center"],"City":"Sioux Falls","StateProvince":"South Dakota","Country":"United States","PostalCode":"57198"}]}}]}
