The product is produced daily in 5-minute temporal increments of satellite acquisition and has a pixel size of 1000 meters (m). The swath is approximately 2030 lines (1000 meter pixels) along track and 1354 pixels wide. Provided along with the temperature layer are MODIS Terra bands 31 and 32, which provide emissivity values, a quality indicator (QC) layer,  a LST error layer, and  4 observation bands. Validation at stage 2 has been achieved for all MODIS LST/Emissivity products.\r\n \r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n•\tRemoved cloud-contaminated LSTs not only from level 3 LST products but also from level 2 LST products, which includes MOD11_L2.\r\n•\tUpdated the coefficient look-up table (LUT) for the split-window algorithm with comprehensive regression analysis of MODIS simulation data in bands 31 and 32 over wide ranges of surface and atmospheric conditions, especially extending the upper boundary for (LST – Ts-air) in arid and semi-arid regions and increasing the overlapping between various sub-ranges in order to reduce the sensitivity of the algorithm to the uncertainties in the input data (i.e., column water vapor and air surface temperature from MxD07).\r\n•\tMade minor adjustments in the classification-based surface emissivity values, especially for bare soil and rocks land cover types.\r\n•\tTuned the day/night algorithm by adjusting weights to improve its performance in desert regions where the incorporated split-window algorithm may not work well.\r\n•\tGenerated new LST products for 8-day and monthly at 6 kilometer grids, in response to user community requests.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD11_L2.006"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2010-10-13T07:39:38.526Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2016-01-20T09:38:20.714Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"ZoneIdentifier":"Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)","Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"GEODETIC"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Name":"GRANULENUMBER","Description":"The number of the granule for the day starting at midnight.
