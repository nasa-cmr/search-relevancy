Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\r\n\r\nMOD09A1 provides Bands 1–7 at 500-meter resolution in an 8-day gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Each MOD09A1 pixel contains the best possible L2G observation during an 8-day period as selected by high-observation coverage, low-view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance values for Bands 1–7, quality assessment, and the day of the year for the pixel along with solar, view, and zenith angles.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance products are Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts. \r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nReduced file volume: internal compression\r\nImproved aerosol retrieval\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: February 18, 2000 - March 29, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nFile Size: ~64 MB \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nImage Dimensions: 2400 x 2400 rows/columns \r\nResolution: 500 meters \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 13","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/295"},{"Description":"         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.
