Produced from both the Terra and Aqua MODIS-derived daily surface reflectance inputs, the algorithm analyzes the daily surface reflectance dynamics to locate rapid changes, uses that information to detect the approximate date of burning, and maps the spatial extent of recent fires only. It provides varied quality assessment information and a single summary quality assessment score for each pixel. \r\n\r\nThe MCD45A1 algorithm improves on previous methods by using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-based change detection approach to handle angular variations in the data. It further uses a statistical measure to identify change probability from a previously observed state. A monthly MCD45A1 product is based on three months of atmospherically and geometrically corrected, cloud-screened daily reflectance data. \r\n\r\nV051 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 2400 x 2400 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: 1.78 MB (Average)\r\nResolution: ~500 meters \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 8","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/25"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived products available from the LP DAAC.
