The GFCC Tree Cover Multi-Year Global dataset is available for four epochs centered on the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The dataset is derived from the GFCC Surface Reflectance product (GFCC30SR), which is based on enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets. The GLS datasets are composed of high-resolution Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30-meter resolution. GFCC30TC provides tree canopy information and can be used to understand forest changes. Each tree cover product features four files associated with it; a tree cover layer with an embedded color map, a tree cover error (uncertainty) file, and an index (provenance) file, plus a list of path/rows that relate to the Surface Reflectance input files. Note that the index file and file list were not generated for the 2015 epoch. Data follow the Worldwide Reference System-2 tiling scheme. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/gfcc_atbd.pdf).","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30TC.003"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:43:52.838Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2017-06-20T08:52:02.853Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"GEODETIC"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Value":"10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30TC.003","Name":"identifier_product_doi","Description":"Digital object identifier that uniquely identifies this data product","DataType":"STRING"},{"Value":"http://dx.doi.org","Name":"identifier_product_doi_authority","Description":"URL of the digital object identifier resolving authority","DataType":"STRING"}],"ScienceKeywords":[{"Category":"EARTH SCIENCE","Topic":"AGRICULTURE","Term":"FOREST SCIENCE","VariableLevel1":"FOREST MANAGEMENT"}],"EntryTitle":"Global Forest Cover Change Tree Cover Mutli-Year Global 30m V003","CollectionProgress":"COMPLETE","ProcessingLevel":{"ProcessingLevelDescription":"Sensor Measurements","Id":"3"},"Platforms":[{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-7","LongName":"LANDSAT-7","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"ETM+","LongName":"Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"LANDSAT-5","LongName":"LANDSAT-5","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Imaging Radiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TM","LongName":"Thematic Mapper","Technique":"Whiskbroom Scanning Radiometry"}]}]},{"Type":"Earth Observation Satellites","ShortName":"TERRA","LongName":"Earth Observing System, TERRA (AM-1)","Characteristics":[{"Name":"EquatorCrossingTime","Description":"Local time of the equator crossing and direction (ascending or descending)","Value":"10:30, descending","Unit":"Local Mean Time","DataType":"varchar"}],"Instruments":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectroradiometry","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"MODIS","LongName":"Cross-track Scanning Radiometer","Technique":"Radiometry"}]},{"ShortName":"ASTER","LongName":"Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer","Technique":"Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers","ComposedOf":[{"ShortName":"TIR","LongName":"Thermal Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"VNIR","LongName":"Visible Near Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"},{"ShortName":"SWIR","LongName":"Shortwave Infrared","Technique":"Imaging Radiometers"}]}]}],"Version":"003","TemporalExtents":[{"TemporalRangeType":"Continuous Range","PrecisionOfSeconds":0,"EndsAtPresentFlag":false,"RangeDateTimes":[{"BeginningDateTime":"1999-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","EndingDateTime":"2015-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"}]}],"DataCenters":[{"Roles":["PROCESSOR"],"ShortName":"UMD/GLCF","LongName":"Global Land Cover Facility, University of Maryland","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"http://glcf.umd.edu/"}],"Addresses":[{"StateProvince":"Maryland","Country":"United States"}]}},{"Roles":["ARCHIVER"],"ShortName":"LP DAAC","LongName":"Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center","ContactInformation":{"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"DataCenterURL","Type":"HOME PAGE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/"}],"ServiceHours":"M-F, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time","ContactInstruction":"None","ContactMechanisms":[{"Type":"Telephone","Value":"605-594-6116"},{"Type":"Fax","Value":"605-594-6963"},{"Type":"Email","Value":"lpdaac@usgs.gov"}],"Addresses":[{"StreetAddresses":["U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center"],"City":"Sioux Falls","StateProvince":"South Dakota","Country":"United States","PostalCode":"57198"}]}}]}
