Designed to continuously represent Earth’s terrestrial surface as a proportion of basic vegetation traits, it provides a gradation of three surface cover components: percent tree cover, percent non-tree cover, and percent bare.  VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover with improved spatial detail, and hence, are widely used in environmental modeling and monitoring applications.\n\nThe first generation of the VCF algorithm involved a semi-automated process to generate regression trees with machine learning software.  A human operator was required to evaluate the tree and decide if it needed more or less training data inputs.  The V003 VCF product is the first version from that generation, and only contains the percent tree cover layer, as does the current V005. The Version 051 released in winter of 2015 contains all 3 surface cover components. Generated yearly, the VCF product is produced using monthly composites of Terra MODIS 250 and 500 meters Land Surface Reflectance data, including all seven bands, and Land Surface Temperature.\n\nSeveral reasons help explain the inter-annual fluctuations in the percentage of tree cover from year to year, and therefore, users should exercise caution when considering performing inter-annual comparisons of VCF.\n\nThe VCF products are validated to stage-1; this means that their product accuracy was estimated through an assessment of the training data’s accuracy, and from limited in situ field validation datasets.\n\nV051 Data Set Characteristics: \nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \nImage Dimensions: 4800 x 4800 rows/columns \nFile Size: 28 MB\nResolution: 250 meters \nProjection: Sinusoidal \nData Format: HDF-EOS \nScience Data Sets (SDS): 7","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/16"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb"},{"Description":"\n         TLP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is one of several discipline-specific data centers within the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).
