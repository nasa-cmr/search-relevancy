{"MetadataDates":[{"Date":"2017-06-12T09:23:00.000Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2017-06-12T09:23:00.000Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"ShortName":"Landsat_TM","Abstract":"Abstract: The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) is a sensor carried \n                onboard Landsats 4 and 5 and has acquired images of the Earth nearly \n                continuously from July 1982 to the present, with a 16-day repeat cycle.\n                Landsat TM image data consist of seven spectral bands (band designations) with a \n                spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1 to 5 and band 7. Spatial resolution for \n                band 6 (thermal infrared) is 120 meters, but band 6 data are oversampled to 30 \n                meter pixel size. Approximate scene size is 170 km north-south by 183 km \n                east-west (106 mi by 114 mi). \n                Systematic Correction (Level 1G) includes both radiometric and geometric correction. \n                The scene will be rotated, aligned, and georeferenced to a user-specified map \n                projection. Absolute geometric accuracy of the systematically corrected Landsat \n                TM product can vary, depending on the accuracy of the predicted ephemeris that \n                is used for processing. Please be aware that TM Level 1G products may require \n                additional image geometric correction and/or co-registration to known ground \n                control points (GCPs). \n                Precision Correction (Level 1P) includes radiometric and geometric correction, as \n                well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve geometric accuracy. For \n                locations outside the United States, accuracy of the precision-corrected product will \n                depend on the availability of local GCPs. \n                Terrain Correction (Level 1T) includes radiometric and geometric precision \n                correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to improve the \n                satellite model and to correct for relief displacement caused by local terrain. For \n                locations outside the United States, the accuracy of a terrain-corrected product will \n                depend on the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the \n                quality of the best available DEM.
