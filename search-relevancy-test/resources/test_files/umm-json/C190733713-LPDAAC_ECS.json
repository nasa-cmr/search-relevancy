Users are advised to ignore QC information until the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product (informally called the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product) provides estimates of the timing of vegetation phenology at global scales. Additionally, it also provides information related to the range and summation of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) computed from MODIS surface reflectance data at each pixel. It identifies the vegetation growth, maturity, and senescence that mark seasonal cycles. In contrast to the version 004 incarnation of this product (MOD12Q2), MCD12Q2 uses both Terra and Aqua MODIS input data. MCD12Q2 is produced once a year with 24 months of input data (i.e., the 12 months of interest data bracketed by six month’s data on either side). The version 005 MCD12Q2 products range from 2001 through 2012.\r\n\r\nMCD12Q2 primarily uses MODIS EVI, which is computed from the MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product instead of the MOD09 surface reflectance product. In contrast to the version 004 product, MCD12Q2 uses NBAR values computed from an 8-day period at 500 m spatial resolution. Huete et al. (2002) provide the formula used to derive the EVI from the NBAR data. The snow and ice flag included in the MODIS NBAR product’s QA field is useful to filter out data points associated with snow-covered surfaces from the input time-series, especially because snow presence introduces large temporal variations in EVI that are not associated with vegetation phenology. Land surface temperature data inputs are derived from the MODIS MOD11A2 8-day composite products. \r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\n- The V005 Land Cover Dynamics product is produced at a higher spatial resolution (500 m) than the V004 product (1000 m).\r\n- The V005 Land Cover Dynamics product uses both Aqua and Terra inputs.\r\n- The V005 Land Cover product uses NBAR values computed from an 8-day period compared to a 16-day period in the V004 product.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS Land Cover Dynamics product provides estimates of the timing of vegetation phenology globally. In addition, it also provides the MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)-adjusted reflectance (NBAR)-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) onset of greenness, and quality control information.\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nTemporal Coverage: 2001-2014\r\nEarth-Gridded Tile Area: 10° x 10° lat/lon (at the equator)\r\nImage Dimensions: 2 x 2400 x 2400 (num_modes/rows/columns) \r\nFile Size: ~165 MB \r\nResolution: 500 meters\r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Type: 16-bit Unsigned Integer\r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (HDF SDS Layers): 8","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/272"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web (MRTWeb) is available for selected MODIS land products.
