In other words, NPP is equal to the difference between the rate at which plants in an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy (or GPP), and the rate at which they expend some of that energy for respiration.  \r\n\r\nThe version-55 of the NPP product is produced by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG)/University of Montana (UMT).  It corrects the problem with cloud-contaminated MODIS LAI-FPAR inputs to the MOD17 algorithm.  The original, uncorrected datasets constitute the version-4 NPP products.  For further details regarding the differences between the NTSG and NASA versions of this product, please consult the document referenced in the following news release: Terra MODIS GPP/NPP Products from NTSG/University of Montana (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/about/news_archive/terra_modis_gppnpp_products_ntsguniversity_montana).  \r\n\r\nVersion-55 Terra/MODIS NPP products are validated to Stage-3; this means that its accuracy was assessed and uncertainties in the product were well-established via independent measurements made in a systematic and statistically robust way that represents global conditions.  These data are deemed ready for use in science applications.\r\n\r\nV055 Data Set Characteristics:\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nImage Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: ~7 MB \r\nResolution: 1000 meters \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 3","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/13"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web (MRTWeb) is available for selected MODIS land products.
