This dataset is computed from all clear-sky pixels of ASTER scenes acquired from 2000 – 2008.  There is also a binary version of the AG1km data, please see AG1kmB for more information.\n\nThe Emissivity Science Data Set in the ASTER GED products is multidimensional, meaning the emissivity layer is a stack of layers including mean and standard deviation for each of the five spectral bands.  Software engineers used MATLAB routines to write the data layer, which are executed in column-major rather than row-major order.  \"Column-major\" means that arrays are read up and down instead of left to right, resulting in an image with values rotated 90 degrees.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, developed the ASTER GED product.  \n\nData Set Characteristics \nArea: ~ 1 degree (°) x 1°\nPixel Resolution: 1-kilometer\nImage Dimensions: 1,000 rows x 1,000 columns\nFile Size: ~471 kilobytes (KB)\nProjection: Geographic latitude and longitude\nData Format: Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5)\nVgroup Data Fields: 19","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/Community/ASTER_GED/AG1km.003"},{"Description":"\n         The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is one of several discipline-specific data centers within the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).
