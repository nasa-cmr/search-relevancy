The MODIS NBAR and land cover–based mask was itself an improved version of the EOS DEM-based land-water mask (Logan et al., 1999). This MODIS 250 m mask is primarily created with three different data inputs: \r\n\r\n1. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission’s (SRTM) Water Body Dataset (SWBD) (Areas between 60° S to 60° N); \r\n2. The MOD44C, a non-public, 250 m global 16-day composite collection based on 8+ years of Terra MODIS data, and 6+ years of Aqua MODIS data. This data set originally provided the input to produce the Vegetative Cover Conversion, and Vegetative Continuous Fields products (Areas between 60° N to 90° N); and \r\n\r\n3. The MODIS–based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA), which is a 250 m MODIS level-1b mosaic for Antarctica (Areas within Antarctica between 60° S and 90° S). \r\nOther appropriate and publicly available data sets were also used to supplement the production of the MODIS 250 m land–water mask. Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the User Guide. \r\n\r\nThis marks the first time that such a global MODIS-SRTM land-water mask is offered publicly to end-users. This data set is provided in the same gridded tile structure that is common to several higher-level MODIS land products. \r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: ~10° x 10° (at the equator) \r\nImage Dimensions: 4800 x 4800 (rows/columns) \r\nFile Size: ~250 KB \r\nResolution: 250 meters \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (HDF SDS Layers): 2","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/286"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=MOD44W5"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
