Designed to continuously represent Earthâ€™s terrestrial surface as a proportion of basic vegetation traits, the data provide a gradation of three surface cover components: percent tree cover, percent non-tree cover, and percent non-vegetated (bare). The three components are each stored in separate layers so they can be used independently to look at a particular type of ground cover or collectively to look at the entire surface. VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover at 250 meter pixel resolution, and hence, are widely used in environmental modeling and monitoring applications.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\nCollection 6 VCF was produced with the same code and training as the Collection 5 products, but improvements to the upstream inputs result in more accurate VCF products.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile
