MOD11C3, therefore, inherits all the structural features of its MOD11C1 parent except for the temporal configuration. Please refer to the MOD11C1 product documentation for all algorithm-related details.\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11C3 product comprises the following Science Data Set (SDS) layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, clear sky coverages, and emissivities for bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32.\r\n\r\nThe V4 Terra/MODIS LST/E products, including MOD11C3, are validated to Stage-1 with well-defined uncertainties over a range of representative conditions. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the LST/E products is available from the following URL: http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov/ProductStatus.php?ProductID=MOD11\r\n\r\nThis product is ready for use in science applications/publications. Subsequent and improved versions of this product also exist.\r\n\r\nThe V4 MOD11C3 product has an acquisition range from March 1, 2000 until December 31, 2006 (2006-365). The V4 collection remains consistent with V41, and users may combine the two collections in a time-series analysis.\r\n\r\nV004 Data Set Characteristics: \r\nArea: Global \r\nImage Dimensions: 3600 x 7200 rows/columns \r\nFile Size: 440 MB \r\nResolution: 5 degrees (~5.6 km at the Equator) \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\nScience Data Sets (SDS HDF Layers): 16","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/284"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=MOD11C34"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived products available from the LP DAAC.
