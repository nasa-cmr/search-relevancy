Along with the 250 m bands are the QC 250 m layer and five observation layers. This product is intended to be used in conjunction with the quality and viewing geometry information of the 500 m product (MOD09GA). Validation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS Surface Reflectance products.\r\n \r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n•\tImprovement to the aerosol retrieval and correction algorithm and use of new aerosol retrieval Look up Tables.\r\n•\tRefinements to the internal snow, cloud, and cloud shadow detection algorithms. Uses BRDF database to better constraint the different threshold used.\r\n•\tProcesses ocean bands to create a new Surface Reflectance Ocean product and provide QA data sets for these bands.\r\n•\tImproved discrimination of salt pans from cloud and snow and flag salt pan in QA band.\r\n","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD09GQ.006"}],"DataDates":[{"Date":"2010-08-31T14:10:59.380Z","Type":"CREATE"},{"Date":"2016-03-21T09:32:15.906Z","Type":"UPDATE"}],"AccessConstraints":{"Description":"None"},"SpatialExtent":{"SpatialCoverageType":"HORIZONTAL","HorizontalSpatialDomain":{"ZoneIdentifier":"Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)","Geometry":{"CoordinateSystem":"CARTESIAN","BoundingRectangles":[{"WestBoundingCoordinate":-180.0,"NorthBoundingCoordinate":90.0,"EastBoundingCoordinate":180.0,"SouthBoundingCoordinate":-90.0}]}},"GranuleSpatialRepresentation":"GEODETIC"},"AdditionalAttributes":[{"Name":"HORIZONTALTILENUMBER","Description":"Horizontal tile number of a grid, which increases from left to right.","DataType":"INT"},{"Name":"QAPERCENTGOODQUALITY","Description":"Percent of pixels with good quality","DataType":"INT"},{"Name":"QAPERCENTNOTPRODUCEDCLOUD","Description":"Percent of pixels under cloud","DataType":"INT"},{"Name":"QAPERCENTNOTPRODUCEDOTHER","Description":"Percent of pixels not produced due to some reason other than cloud","DataType":"INT"},{"Name":"QAPERCENTOTHERQUALITY","Description":"Percent of pixels with not so good quality","DataType":"INT"},{"Name":"QAPERCENTPOOROUTPUT500MBAND3","Description":"The % of pixels in 500m band 3 that have a quality of our lowest class (i.e. not usable) .
