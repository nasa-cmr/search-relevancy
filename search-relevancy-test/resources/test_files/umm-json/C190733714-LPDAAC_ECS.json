The Level-1B data set is produced by applying the radiometric calibration and geometric correction coefficients to the Level-1A. Both intra-telescope and inter-telescope registration correction for all the Bands are accomplished relative to the reference Band for each sub-system (Bands 2, 6, and 11). The Level-1B radiance data set offers the same number of Bands at the same resolution as the Level-1A, and provides the input for generating a number of derived Level-2 geophysical products.\r\n\r\nUsers are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008 to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods.
