Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.\r\n\r\nMOD09GA provides Bands 1-7 in a daily gridded L2G product in the Sinusoidal projection, including 500-meter reflectance values and 1-kilometer observation and geolocation statistics. 500-meter Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance for Bands 1-7, a quality rating, observation coverage, observation number, and 250-meter scan information. 1-kilometer Science Data Sets provided include number of observations, quality state, sensor angles, solar angles, geolocation flags, and orbit pointers.\r\n\r\nVersion-5 MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance products are Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts. \r\n\r\nChange Points of Interest\r\n\r\nReduced number of data products: MOD09GST, MOD09GHK, MODMGGAD, MODPT1KD, and MODPTHKM encapsulated within MOD09GA\r\nRevised methodology for choosing first layer observation\r\nReduced file volume: internal compression\r\n\r\nV005 Data Set Characteristics:\r\nTemporal Coverage: February 24, 2000 - March 30, 2017\r\nArea: ~10 degrees x 10 degrees lat/long \r\nFile Size: ~85 MB \r\nProjection: Sinusoidal \r\nData Format: HDF-EOS \r\n1-km Data Group Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 rows/columns \r\n1-km Data Group Science Data Sets: (SDS HDF Layers) 9 (1) \r\n500-m Data Group Dimensions: 2400 x 2400 rows/columns \r\n500-m Data Group Science Data Sets: (SDS HDF Layers) 12 (2)","Purpose":"Science Research","TilingIdentificationSystems":[{"TilingIdentificationSystemName":"MODIS Tile SIN","Coordinate1":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":35.0},"Coordinate2":{"MinimumValue":0.0,"MaximumValue":17.0}}],"RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=terra&ver=C5"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/6"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"https://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool/"},{"Description":"\n         The MODIS Reprojection Tool on the Web (MRTWeb) is available for selected MODIS land products.
