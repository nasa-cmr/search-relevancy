Along with MODIS bands 1-7 are 18 additional 5600 m resolution layers including thermal bands 20, 21, 31, and 32 in Brightness Temperature and the QA and observation bands. This product is based on a Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) for use in climate simulation models. Validation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS Surface Reflectance products.","Purpose":"Science Research","RelatedUrls":[{"URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/qaFlagPage.cgi?sat=aqua&ver=C6"},{"Description":"Data set landing page at the LP DAAC","URLContentType":"PublicationURL","Type":"VIEW RELATED INFORMATION","Subtype":"GENERAL DOCUMENTATION","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD09CMG.006"},{"Description":"\n         Interface to search, discover, and access EOS data products, and invoke available data services.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"REVERB","URL":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/"},{"Description":"\n         LP DAAC Data Pool provides direct access to all currently available MODIS products and the ability to download them via HTTP.\n      ","URLContentType":"DistributionURL","Type":"GET DATA","Subtype":"ON-LINE ARCHIVE","URL":"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool"},{"Description":"\n         USGS EarthExplorer (EE) provides users the ability to query, search and order archived ASTER and MODIS products available from the LP DAAC.
